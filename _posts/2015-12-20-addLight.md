WhitestormJS's lights are quite easy to add. There are point lights, directional lights, and spot lights.

The basic syntax for adding lights consists of the following:

```javascript
var type = "point";
GAME.addLight(type, {
  color: 0xffffff, // the light's color
  intensity: 1, // the light's intensity
  distance: 1000 // the light's distance
}, {
  x: 100, // the
  y: 100, // light's
  z: 100 // position
}, {
  x: 0, // where the
  y: 0, // light is
  z: 0 // pointing
});
```

In this example, `GAME` is an instance of `WHS.init`.

The `type` variable can be `"spot"`, `"point"`, `"directional"`, `"ambient"`, `"hemisphere"`, or `"area"`.
