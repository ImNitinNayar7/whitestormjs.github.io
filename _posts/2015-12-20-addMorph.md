To add a morph to your game, call `GAME.addMorph`. In the following example we'll be adding [this parrot](https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js/blob/master/examples/assets/models/morph/parrot.js):

```javascript
GAME.parrot = GAME.addMorph("assets/models/morph/parrot.js", {
  geometryOptions: {
    width: 2,
    height: 2,
    depth: 2
  },
  materialOptions: {
    color: 0xffffff,
    kind: basic,
    map: WHS.API.texture("assets/textures/box.jpg")
  },
  pos: {
    x: 70,
    y: 72,
    z: 70
  },
  morph: {
    duration: 0.5,
    speed: 250
  }
});
```

In this example, `GAME` is an instance of `WHS.init`. `addMorph`'s first parameter must be a path to the morph's definition. Its second parameter is the morph's configuration.
